  abstract  = {We consider transmission over a discrete-time Rayleigh fading channel, in which successive symbols face independent fading, and where neither the transmitter nor the receiver has channel state information. Subject to an average power constraint, we study the capacity-achieving distribution of this channel and prove it to be discrete with a finite number of mass points, one of them located at the origin. We numerically compute the capacity and the corresponding optimal distribution as a function of the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). The behavior of the channel at low SNR is studied and finally a comparison is drawn with the ideal additive white Gaussian noise channel.},

  Abstract                 = {Suppose that we observe noisy linear measurements of an unknown signal that can be modeled as the sum of two component signals, each of which arises from a nonlinear sub-manifold of a high-dimensional ambient space. We introduce Successive Projections onto INcoherent manifolds (SPIN), a first-order projected gradient method to recover the signal components. Despite the nonconvex nature of the recovery problem and the possibility of underdetermined measurements, SPIN provably recovers the signal components, provided that the signal manifolds are incoherent and that the measurement operator satisfies a certain restricted isometry property. SPIN significantly extends the scope of current recovery models and algorithms for low-dimensional linear inverse problems and matches (or exceeds) the current state of the art in terms of performance.},

The model differs from that of Shannon in that a different constraint is imposed on the allowable input signals, and in addition the transmission of a code word in a given time interval is not assumed to interfere with the transmission of a word in any other interval. The capacity of the Fortet channel is established by proving a coding theorem and its weak converse. It is shown that the probability of error of an optimal code approaches zero exponentially with the time duration of the code words, provided the transmission rate is below channel capacity.},

These results, combined with previous results on capacity when the constraint covariance is the same as the noise covariance, provide a complete and general solution for the information capacity of the Gaussian channel without feedback. The results are valid for both continuous-time and discrete-time channels and require only two assumptions: the noise is due to a stochastic process with sample paths having finite energy over the observation period (w.p.1), and the constraint is given in terms of a Hilbert space norm. Such a constraint is implicit in any constraint giving finite capacity.},

  Abstract                 = {Coding capacity is considered for a class of additive dimension-limited channels. The channels may be with or without memory, stationary or nonstationary. The constraint is partially given in terms of an increasing family of finite-dimensional subspaces. A general expression for the capacity is obtained, which depends on the family of subspaces and the relation between the noise covariance and the covariance giving the energy-frequency constraint on the transmitted signal. This result holds for all classical discrete-time Gaussian channels and for continuous-time Gaussian channels with fixed time of transmission, so long as a peak energy constraint is used on the codewords. The expression also provides upper bounds for a class of non-Gaussian channels. Several results are obtained that aid in calculation of capacity for specific applications. For this class of channels, it is shown that coding capacity is equal to information capacity. Error bounds are given for Gaussian channels},

It is required only that the signal satisfy a reproducing kernel Hilbert space constraint on expected energy. This requires the, signal energy to be distributed in regions where the noise energy, is not too small, and is the weakest condition that provides finite capacity. In the case when both the noise covariance and the filter on the message are expressed by rational functions, the results complement those previously obtained by Gallager and Holsinger (1968), and the combination gives a complete solution to the capacity problem. The treatment provides a desirable generality on the class of transmitted signals that is not present in previous treatments},

  abstract  = {The following sampling theorem is proved: Let f(t) be a bounded band-limited function, possibly a sample of a nonstationary stochastic process, such that |f(t)| < B. Denote by wo the appropriately defined bandwidth of f(t). Let tk denote the set of instants for which f(t) = C cos 2?wt, with C > B and w > w0. Then f(0) and tk determine uniquely f(t). Namely f(t) is represented, up to a multiplicative constant, by its sine-wave-crossings, i.e., by the set of its argument values at which it crosses a given sinusoid the amplitude and the frequency of which exceed, respectively, the bound on f(t) and the limit on its band.



The reconstruction of f(t) from f(0) and tk is a noncausal operation. A practical feedback scheme that interpolates a causal estimate of f(t) from the set of its past sine-wave-crossings and from f(0) is introduced. The input to the circuit is a binary waveform: its phase changes occur at tk and its amplitude is linear in f(0).},

The information transfer is bounded and symptotically determined for the Wiener phase-modulated process input at large signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). Both results are compared to the information transfer for the capacity-achieving Gauss-Markov input process. For both the Wiener phase-modulated and the Gauss-Markov processes the information transfer increases asymptotically as the square root of SNR, but for the random telegraph wave it increases only as its logarithm},

  Abstract                 = {In February 2002, the Federal Communications Commission allocated 7500 MHz of spectrum for unlicensed use of commercial ultra-wideband (UWB) communication devices. This spectral allocation has initiated an extremely productive activity for industry and academia. Wireless communications experts now consider UWB as available spectrum to be utilized with a variety of techniques, and not specifically related to the generation and detection of short RF pulses as in the past. There are many differences between real-world behavior of narrow-band and UWB systems. All wireless systems must be able to deal with the challenges of operating over a multipath propagation channel, where objects in the environment can cause multiple reflections to arrive at the receiver (RX). For narrow-band systems, these reflections will not be resolvable by the RX when the narrow-band system bandwidth is less than the coherence bandwidth of the channel. The large bandwidth of UWB waveforms, instead, significantly increases the ability of the RX to resolve the different reflections in the channel. The UWB channel model developed by the IEEE 802.15.3a standard body is described in this paper. For highly dispersive channels, an orthogonal frequency- division multiplexing (OFDM) RX is more efficient at capturing multipath energy than an equivalent single-carrier system using the same total bandwidth. OFDM systems possess additional desirable properties, such as high spectral efficiency, inherent resilience to narrow-band RF interference, and spectral flexibility, which is important because the regulatory rules for UWB devices have not been finalized throughout the entire world. This paper describes the design of a UWB system optimized for very high bit-rate, low-cost, and low-power wireless networks for personal computing (PC), consumer electronics (CE), and mobile applications. The system combines OFDM modulation technique with a multibanding approach, which divides the spectrum into several sub-bands, whose bandwidth is approximately 500 MHz. The system described in this paper has been selected by several key industry organizations [Mulitband OFDM Alliance, WiMedia, Wireless Universal Serial Bus (USB)] because of its very good technical characteristics for the diverse set of high performance- short-range applications that are eagerly anticipated for CE, PC, and mobile applications.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with various aspects of the characterization of randomly time-variant linear channels. At the outset it is demonstrated that time-varying linear channels (or filters) may be characterized in an interesting symmetrical manner in time and frequency variables by arranging system functions in (timefrequency) dual pairs. Following this a statistical characterization of randomly time-variant linear channels is carried out in terms of correlation functions for the various system functions. These results are specialized by considering three classes of practically interesting channels. These are the wide-sense stationary (WSS) channel, the uncorrelated scattering (US) channel, and the wide-sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel. The WSS and US channels are shown to be (time-frequency) duals. Previous discussions of channel correlation functions and their relationships have dealt exclusively with the WSSUS channel. The point of view presented here of dealing with the dually related system functions and starting with the unrestricted linear channels is considerably more general and places in proper perspective previous results on the WSSUS channel. Some attention is given to the problem of characterizing radio channels. A model called the Quasi-WSSUS channel is presented to model the behavior of such channels. All real-life channels and signals have an essentially finite number of degrees of freedom due to restrictions on time duration and bandwidth. This fact may be used to derive useful canonical channel models with the aid of sampling theorems and power series expansions. Several new canonical channel models are derived in this paper, some of which are dual to those of Kailath.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of this paper is to introduce the reader to the elments of time-domain electromagnetics, which includes baseband-pulse technology and target-signature analysis. Baseband pulses are video or carrierless pulses of very short duration, whose spectral content is concentrated primarily from zero frequency through the microwave region of the spectrum. Work in baseband technology began more than ten years ago at the Sperry Research Center with emphasis primarily on its use as an analytical tool, initially to explore the properties of microwave networks [1], and subsequently to determine the intrinsic properties of materials [2]. The experimental phases of these studies were aided by the pioneering development by the Hewlett-Packard Company of their sampling oscilloscope [3]. These techniques were further extended to experimentally analyze and synthesize antenna radiating and receiving elements [4], [5]. Success in the antenna area led to the development of an indoor ground-plane scattering range to measure the impulse properties of targets or obstacles [6]. This type of range obviated the need for an expensive anechoic chamber since time-gating techniques permitted unwanted reflections from the walls and ceilings to be easily eliminated. A sampling oscillosope and an instrumentation computer were used to process target-signature data as a function of illumination angle. At about the same time, analytical techniques were developed which permitted target-signature analysis to be carried out efficiently and accurately in the time domain [7]. Applications where threshold rather than target-signature data is sufficient were also investigated, and for these applications it became clear that because of cost, the sampling oscilloscope had to be replaced by a stable and fast-acting threshold device. To meet this requirement, two different types of tunnel-diode receivers were developed. The successful developmemt of these receivers, together with the design of inexpensive microwave delay-line ranging techniques, led to the evolution of BAseband Radar (BAR) or free-space time-domain reflectometry. BAR devices have been designed and recently demonstrated for various applications, including auto precollision sensing, spaceship docking, airport surface-traffic control- , auto braking, tanker-ship docking, harborcollision avoidance, etc. These sensing applications cover ranges from 5 to 5000 ft [8]. In other applications, the development of high-speed subnanosecond logic has impacted the computer field, making higher speed computation possible. Further developments resulted in the construction of a subnanosecond, single coaxial cable scheme for multiplexing data between computer terminals [9]. More recently, baseband-pulse techniques have been applied to the problem of developing a short-range wireless communication link. Here, the low EM pollution and covertness of operation potentially provide the means for wireless transmission without licensing. We review the research areas described above in more detail and refer the reader to references and a comprehensive biblography where sources for detailed information can be found [10].},

  abstract  = {The discrete wavelet transform (DWT) is attractive for many reasons. Its sparse sampling grid eliminates redundancy and is very efficient. Its localized basis functions are well suited for processing non?stationary signals such as transients. On the other hand, its lack of translation invariance is a major pitfall for applications such as radar and sonar, particularly in a multipath environment where numerous signal components arrive with arbitrary delays. The paper proposes the use of robust representations as a solution to the translation invariance problem. We measure robustness in terms of a mean square error for which we derive an expression that describes this translation error in the Zak domain. We develop an iterative algorithm in the Zak domain for designing increasingly robust representations. The result is an approach for generating multiresolution subspaces that retain most of their coefficient energy as the input signal is shifted. A typical robust subspace retains 98\% of its energy, a significant improvement over more traditional wavelet representations.},

  Abstract                 = {It is desirable to have a stable reconstruction, in the sense of a uniformly convergent reconstruction process, for a class of functions as large as possible. Therefore, in this paper general sampling series are analyzed for the frequently utilized Paley-Wiener space PW_\pi^1, which is the largest space in the scale of Paley-Wiener spaces consisting of bounded and bandlimited functions. The analysis is done not only for the Shannon sampling series, but for a whole class of axiomatically defined reconstruction processes. It is shown that for this very general class, which contains all common sampling series including the Shannon sampling series, a stable reconstruction is not possible for the space PW_\pi^1. Moreover, a universal function is given that shows the divergence behavior for all sampling series. Finally, a lower and an upper bound is derived and used to describe the asymptotic behavior of the peak value of the finite sampling series.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper we discuss the interplay between discrete-time and continuous-time signals and the question, whether certain properties of the signal in one domain carry over to the other domain. The Shannon sampling series and the more general Valiron interpolation series are the appropriate means to obtain the continuous-time, bandlimited signal out of its samples, i.e., the discrete-time signal. Furthermore, we investigate the symmetric sampling series and the behavior of the non-symmetric sampling series, which follows from the properties of the projection operator. It is well known, that the space of discretetime signals with finite energy and the space of continuoustime, bandlimited signals with finite energy are isomorphic. Thus, discrete-time and continuous-time, bandlimited signals with finite energy can be used interchangeably. This interchangeability is not restricted to finite energy signals. It is valid for a considerably larger class, but not for the space of bounded signals: Even if the discrete-time signal is bounded, the corresponding bandlimited interpolation can be unbounded. For the proof we explicitly state such a bounded discrete-time signal. Furthermore, we show not only that the Shannon sampling series diverges for this signal, but also that there is no bounded, bandlimited interpolation at all.},

This paper considers the basis selection problem for three different applications, starting with a problem from system theory, looking on entropy based methods from information theory, and finally it investigates the peak-to-average power ratio problem in communication systems. In particular, it is investigated under which conditions the problems are solvable, that is under which conditions there exists an appropriate basis.},

  Abstract                 = {A conditionally Gaussian channel is a vector channel in which the channel output, given the channel input, has a Gaussian distribution with (well-behaved) input-dependent mean and covariance. We study the capacity-achieving probability measure for conditionally Gaussian channels subject to bounded-input constraints and average cost constraints. Many practical communication systems, including additive Gaussian noise channels, certain optical channels, fading channels, and interference channels fall within this framework. Subject to bounded-input constraint (and average cost constraints), we show that the channel capacity is achievable and we derive a necessary and sufficient condition for a probability measure to be capacity achieving. Under certain conditions, the capacity-achieving measure is proved to be discrete.},

  abstract  = {The effect on the probability of error from intersymbol interference caused by a repeated use of a continuous-time Gaussian channel is examined. The model assumes that signals that are power constrained are put through a linear filter after which Gaussian noise is added to produce the received signal. One can view the linear filter as a frequency constraint on the inputs. Because of the memory in the filter, past inputs affect the filter output for the current input. It is shown that this interference can be treated as an additional input whose reproducing kernel Hilbert space (RKHS) norm is upper bounded by a function that tends to 0 with increasing block length. Describing the channel in RKHS terms, we show that the exponential error bounds obtained by Gallager are unchanged if one takes intersymbol interference into account.},

  abstract  = {The design of a finite impulse response (FIR) filter often involves a spectral "mask" that the magnitude spectrum must satisfy. The mask specifies upper and lower bounds at each frequency and, hence, yields an infinite number of constraints. In current practice, spectral masks are often approximated by discretization, but in this paper, we derive a result that allows us to precisely enforce piecewise constant and piecewise trigonometric polynomial masks in a finite and convex manner via linear matrix inequalities. While this result is theoretically satisfying in that it allows us to avoid the heuristic approximations involved in discretization techniques, it is also of practical interest because it generates competitive design algorithms (based on interior point methods) for a diverse class of FIR filtering and narrowband beamforming problems. The examples we provide include the design of standard linear and nonlinear phase FIR filters, robust "chip" waveforms for wireless communications, and narrowband beamformers for linear antenna arrays. Our main result also provides a contribution to system theory, as it is an extension of the well-known positive-real and bounded-real lemmas.},

  abstract  = {In this paper, a method for the design of nonlinear phase, full-band, ultra-wideband (UWB) pulses that satisfy the Federal Communications Commission's effective isotropic radiation power spectrum mask, or more generally, any other given mask, is introduced. The method uses convex programming in each step of the iterative procedure that updates the phase distribution of the goal function. Thanks to its mathematical structure, this method can be easily modified in order to be applied, in sequential fashion, to several different orthogonal UWB pulse-design problems, addressed later in the paper. The first among them is a problem considered in literature-design of multiple pulses, orthogonal when radiated. When employed for solving this problem, the method proposed here produces a considerably larger number of orthogonal pulses with high energy compared to the methods introduced before. As a novelty, the problem of designing pulses which are orthogonal in reception is considered. Then, a modification of our method is presented that can be used to solve this problem. We also introduce statistical criteria of robustness of pulses' orthogonality in reception, to the variation of the pulses' shape caused by the channel transfer function. After that, a modification of the proposed method is presented that is capable of producing a set of pulses with predefined maximum value of this criteria. Furthermore, it is shown that the method proposed can be used to efficiently design orthogonal pulses using a suboptimal value of the sample rate. All the concepts introduced are illustrated by design examples},

  abstract  = {The measure-theoretic definition of Kullback?Leibler relative-entropy (or simply KL-entropy) plays a basic role in defining various classical information measures on general spaces. Entropy, mutual information and conditional forms of entropy can be expressed in terms of KL-entropy and hence properties of their measure-theoretic analogs will follow from those of measure-theoretic KL-entropy. These measure-theoretic definitions are key to extending the ergodic theorems of information theory to non-discrete cases. A fundamental theorem in this respect is the Gelfand?Yaglom?Perez (GYP) Theorem [M.S. Pinsker, Information and Information Stability of Random Variables and Process, 1960, Holden-Day, San Francisco, CA (English ed., 1964, translated and edited by Amiel Feinstein), Theorem. 2.4.2] which states that measure-theoretic relative-entropy equals the supremum of relative-entropies over all measurable partitions. This paper states and proves the GYP-theorem for R{\'e}nyi relative-entropy of order greater than one. Consequently, the result can be easily extended to Tsallis relative-entropy.},

  abstract  = {Differential, transmitted reference (TR) and energy detection (ED) based ultra-wideband impulse radios (UWBIR) can collect the rich multipath energy offered by UWB channels with a low-complexity receiver. However, they perform satisfactorily only when the channel induced inter-pulse interference (IPI) is negligible. This can be achieved by appending a guard interval with duration greater than or equal to the channel's delay spread to each frame  an operation limiting the maximum achievable data rate. As a remedy, this Letter advocates block transmissions in conjunction with orthogonal spreading sequences to remove the introduced IPI. The resultant scheme requires no channel knowledge besides timing offset and incurs slightly more complexity than non-block alternatives, while it increases the data rate at no cost in error performance. Given a fixed data rate of 25Mbps, the novel block scheme exhibits about 1.8 dB gain relative to its non-block counterpart in single-user simulated tests.},

We apply the results of the first part to a commonly known baseband, discrete-time multiple-antenna system where both the transmitter and receiver know the channel's statistical law. We analyze the capacity for additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) channels, fading channels with full channel state information (CSI) at the receiver, fading channels with no CSI, and fading channels with partial CSI at the receiver. For each type of channels, we study the capacity value as well as issues such as the existence, uniqueness, and characterization of the capacity-achieving measures for different types of moment constraints. The results are applicable to both Rayleigh and Rician fading channels in the presence of arbitrary line-of-sight and correlation profiles.},

  abstract  = {The purpose of these studies is an inquiry into the essence of the "information" conveyed by channels of communication, and the application of the result of this inquiry to the practical problem of optimum utilization of frequency bands.

In Part 1, a new method of analysing signals is presented in which time and frequency play symmetrical parts, and which contains "time analysis" and "frequency analysis" as special cases. It is shown that the information conveyed by a frequency band in a given time-interval can be analysed in various ways into the same number of elementary "quanta of information," each quantum conveying one numerical datum.

In Part 2, this method is applied to the analysis of hearing sensations. It is shown on the basis of existing experimental material that in the band between 60 an 1000 c/s the human ear can discriminate very nearly every second datum of information, and that this efficiency of nearly 50 percent is independent of the duration of the signals in a remarkably wide interval. This fact, which cannot be explained by any mechanism in the inner ear, suggests a new phenomenon in nerve conduction. At frequencies above 1000 c/s the efficiency of discrimination falls off sharply, proving that sound reproductions which are far from faithful may be perceived by the ear as perfect, and that "condensed" methods of transmission and reproduction with improved waveband economy are possible in principle.

In Part 3, suggestions are discussed for compresse transmission and reproduction of speech or music, and the first experimental results obtained with one of these methods are described.},

  abstract  = {In the case of band-limited signals, the sampling theorem permits us to replace analytic operations with algebraic operations. We are then able to discuss problems of measurement of information, coding, and transmission over noisy channels in terms of discrete samples, rather than continuous time functions. The design of the optimum linear filter reduces from a very difficult analysis problem involving spec- trum factorizatlon to a straightforward problem of solving a set of simultaneous linear equations. Unless we are interested in the most economical implementation, it is not even necessary to solve the equations. since a synthesis procedure involving only simple functions of the correlation functions is available. When extended to the general nonlinear case, the design is still specified by a set of simultaneous algebraic equations, but the labor of solution grows very rapidly. It is proposed to short circuit this labor by building a learning filter which in effect designs itself. A training period in which the adjust- ments are automatically optimized precedes the use period. By modi- fying the training program, it is possible that the filter could be taught to recognize specific signals, including, perhaps, certain speech sounds},

The major advantages of the present approach are the simplicity of the derivations and the relative simplicity of the results; on the other hand, the exponential behavior of the bounds with block length is the best known for all transmission rates between0and capacity. The results are applied to a number of special channels, including the binary symmetric channel and the additive Gaussian noise channel.},

Because these pulses are derived from and have shapes that are either equal or similar to the Hermite pulses, we name our proposed transmit pulses as spectrally efficient Hermite pulses. Given that the proposed set of pulses does not constitute an orthonormal one, we also propose a set of receive templates which permit orthonormal detection of the incoming signals at the receiver. The importance of our proposal is in the potential implementation of M-ary pulse shape modulation systems, for ultra wideband communications, with sets of pulses that are efficiently contained within a specific bandwidth and limited to a certain amplitude.},

  year      = {2009},

  abstract  = {The theory of Compressive Sensing (CS) exploits a well-known concept used in signal compression ? sparsity ? to design new, efficient techniques for signal acquisition. CS theory states that for a length-N signal x with sparsity level K, M = O(K log(N/K)) random linear projections of x are sufficient to robustly recover x in polynomial time. However, richer models are often applicable in real-world settings that impose additional structure on the sparse nonzero coefficients of x. Many such models can be succinctly described as a union of K-dimensional subspaces. In recent work, we have developed a general approach for the design and analysis of robust, efficient CS recovery algorithms that exploit such signal models with structured sparsity. We apply our framework to a new signal model which is motivated by neuronal spike trains. We model the firing process of a single Poisson neuron with absolute refractoriness using a union of subspaces. We then derive a bound on the number of random projections M needed for stable embedding of this signal model, and develop a algorithm that provably recovers any neuronal spike train from M measurements. Numerical experimental results demonstrate the benefits of our model-based approach compared to conventional CS recovery techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {The discrete-time Gaussian channel with intersymbol interference (ISI) where the inputs are subject to a per symbol average-energy constraint is considered. The capacity of this channel is derived by means of a hypothetical channel model called the N-circular Gaussian channel (NCGC), whose capacity is readily derived using the theory of the discrete Fourier transform. The results obtained for the NCGC are used further to prove that, in the limit of increasing block length N, the capacity of the discrete-time Gaussian channel (DTGC) with ISI using a per block average-energy input constraint (N -block DTGC) is indeed also the capacity when using the per symbol average-energy constraint.},

  abstract  = {In this paper the Zak transform which i a signal transform relevant to time-continuous signals at uniform rate and an arbitrary clock phase. Besides being time-frequency representation for time-continuous signals. the Zak transform is a particularly useful tool in signal theory. It can be used to provide a framework within which celebrated themes like Fourier inversion theorem, Parseval's theorem, the Nyquist criterion, the Shannon sampling theorem, and the Gabor representation problem fit. Moreover the Zak transform is of particular use for solving linear integral equations, the kernel of which is th autocorrelation function of a cyclostationary random process. This paper lists and interprets the numerous properties of the Zak transform; to one of these properties, the occurrence of zeros of Zak transforms, special attention is paid. Furthermore, the relation with other time-frequency representations such as the Wigner distribution and radar ambiguity function is given, and the Gabor representation problem tackled.



Finally, an example of how to use the Zak transform is given by solving data transmission problems where a robust filter, with or without decision feedback, has to be designed with optimal performance properties with respect to intersymbol interference and noise suppression.},

  Abstract                 = {In decision theory, mathematical analysis shows that once the sampling distribution, loss function, and sample are specified, the only remaining basis for a choice among different admissible decisions lies in the prior probabilities. Therefore, the logical foundations of decision theory cannot be put in fully satisfactory form until the old problem of arbitrariness (sometimes called "subjectiveness") in assigning prior probabilities is resolved. The principle of maximum entropy represents one step in this direction. Its use is illustrated, and a correspondence property between maximum-entropy probabilities and frequencies is demonstrated. The consistency of this principle with the principles of conventional "direct probability" analysis is illustrated by showing that many known results may be derived by either method. However, an ambiguity remains in setting up a prior on a continuous parameter space because the results lack invariance under a change of parameters; thus a further principle is needed. It is shown that in many problems, including some of the most important in practice, this ambiguity can be removed by applying methods of group theoretical reasoning which have long been used in theoretical physics. By finding the group of transformations on the parameter space which convert the problem into an equivalent one, a basic desideratum of consistency can be stated in the form of functional equations which impose conditions on, and in some cases fully determine, an "invariant measure" on the parameter space},

  Abstract                 = {A mathematical model that leads to singular detection (i.e., detection with arbitrarily low probability of error) is usually a poor model of the physical problem. However, in general, it has been difficult to establish the possibility of singular detection without a detailed evaluation of the probability of error. Such an evaluation is difficult because it requires the solution of various integral equations, the computation of eigenvalues, etc. In this paper some simple methods are given for predicting the possibility of singular detection of known signals in additive gaussian noise. Such methods are useful in the formulation of suitable mathematical models.},

  Abstract                 = {The problem of the detection of known signals in colored Gaussian noise is usually studied through infinite-series representations for the signals and noise. In particular, the Karhunen-Loève (K-L) expansion is often used for this purpose. Such infinite-series methods, while elegant, often introduce mathematical complications because they raise questions of convergence, interchange of orders of integration, etc. The resolution of these problems is difficult and has led, when the K-L expansion is used, to the introduction of subsidiary conditions whose physical meaning is often unclear. We present a method of reducing the detection problem to a finite-dimensional form where many of the difficulties with the infinite-series K-L expansion do not arise. The resulting simplicity provides more direct derivations of and more physical insights into several earlier results. It has also suggested some new results. The method is essentially based on the use of a projection in a special kind of Hilbert space called a reproducing kernel Hilbert space.},

Such superposition leads to more than two received levels with binary input, but in return permits realization of the Nyquist rate (2F symbols/s in bandwidthF). Appropriate choice of the superposition coefficients provides a variety of spectral distributions to suit individual applications. The most interesting classes of system functions are defined, the associated coding procedures are described, and the performance characteristics are summarized.},

  Abstract                 = {The sampling theorem for bandlimited signals of finite energy can be interpreted in two ways, associated with the names of Nyquist and Shannon. 1) Every signal of finite energy and bandwidth W Hz may be completely recovered, in a simple way, from a knowledge of its samples taken at the rate of 2W per second (Nyquist rate). Moreover, the recovery is stable, in the sense that a small error in reading sample values produces only a correspondingly small error in the recovered signal. 2) Every square-summable sequence of numbers may be transmitted at the rate of 2W per second over an ideal channel of bandwidth W Hz, by being represented as the samples of an easily constructed band-limited signal of finite energy. The practical importance of these results, together with the restrictions implicit in the sampling theorem, make it natural to ask whether the above rates cannot be improved, by passing to differently chosen sampling instants, or to bandpass or multiband (rather than bandlimited) signals, or to more elaborate computations. In this paper we draw a distinction between reconstructing a signal from its samples, and doing so in a stable way, and we argue that only stable sampling is meaningful in practice. We then prove that: 1) stable sampling cannot be performed at a rate lower than the Nyquist, 2) data cannot be transmitted as samples at a rate higher than the Nyquist, regardless of the location of sampling instants, the nature of the set of frequencies which the signals occupy, or the method of construction. These conclusions apply not merely to finite-energy, but also to bounded, signals.},

  abstract  = {We consider the problem of designing a perfect-reconstruction, FIR, quadrature-mirror filter (QMF) bank (H, G) adapted to input signal statistics, with the coding gain as the adaptation criterion. Maximization of the coding gain has so far been viewed as a difficult nonlinear constrained optimization problem. It is shown that the coding gain depends only on the product filter P(z)=H(z)H(z-1), and this transformation leads to a stable class of linear optimization problems having finitely many variables and infinitely many constraints, termed linear semi-infinite programming (SIP) problems. The sought-for, original filter H(z) is obtained by deflation and spectral factorization of P(z). With the SIP formulation, every locally optimal solution is also globally optimal and can be computed using reliable numerical algorithms. The natural regularity properties inherent in the SIP formulation enhance the performance of these algorithms. We present a comprehensive theoretical analysis of the SIP problem and its dual, characterize the optimal filters, and analyze uniqueness and sensitivity issues. All these properties are intimately related to those of the input signal and bring considerable insight into the nature of the adaptation process. We present discretization and cutting plane algorithms and apply both methods to several examples},

  abstract  = {The most obvious method for determining the distortion of telegraph signals is to calculate the transients of the telegraph system. This method has been treated by various writers, and solutions are available for telegraph lines with simple terminal conditions. It is well known that the extension of the same methods to more complicated terminal conditions, which represent the usual terminal apparatus, leads to great difficulties. The present paper attacks the same problem from the alternative standpoint of the steady-state characteristics of the system. This method has the advantage over the method of transients that the complication of the circuit which results from the use of terminal apparatus does not complicate the calculations materially. This method of treatment necessitates expressing the criteria of distortionless transmission in terms of the steady-state characteristics. Accordingly, a considerable portion of the paper describes and illustrates a method for making this translation. A discussion is given of the minimum frequency range required for transmission at a given speed of signaling. In the case of carrier telegraphy, this discussion includes a comparison of single-sideband and double-sideband transmission. A number of incidental topics is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {It may fairly be said that modern time series analysis is a subject which embraces three fields which while closely related have tended to develop somewhat independently. These fields are (i) statistical communication and control theory, (ii) the probabilistic (and Hilbert space) theory of stochastic processes processing finite second moments, and (iii) the statistical theory of regression analysis, correlation analysis, and spectral (or harmonic) analysis of time series. In this paper it is my aim to show the close relation between these fields and to summarize some recent developments. The topics discussed are (i) stationary time series and their statistical analysis, (ii) prediction theory and the Hilbert space spanned by a time series, and (iii) regression analysis of time series with known covariance function. In particular, I describe a new approach to prediction and regression problems using reproducing kernel Hilbert spaces.},

  Abstract                 = {The results of indoor multipath propagation measurements using 10 ns, 1.5 GHz, radarlike pulses are presented for a medium-size office building. The observed channel was very slowly time varying, with the delay spread extending over a range up to about 200 ns and rms values of up to about 50 ns. The attenuation varied over a 60 dB dynamic range. A simple statistical multipath model of the indoor radio channel is also presented, which fits our measurements well, and more importantly, appears to be extendable to other buildings. With this model, the received signal rays arrive in clusters. The rays have independent uniform phases, and independent Rayleigh amplitudes with variances that decay exponentially with cluster and ray delays. The clusters, and the rays within the cluster, form Poisson arrival processes with different, but fixed, rates. The clusters are formed by the building superstructure, while the individual rays are formed by objects in the vicinities of the transmitter and the receiver.},

Then we reformulate the basis problem in a more general setting, and discuss Beurling-type density theorems for sampling and interpolation. Next, we state some multiplier theorems, of a similar nature as the famous Beurling-Malliavin theorem, and sketch their role in the subject. Finally, we discuss extensions of nonharmonic Fourier series to weighted Paley-Wiener spaces, and indicate how these spaces are explored via de Branges' Hilbert spaces of entire functions.},

  Abstract                 = {The classical direct detection optical channel is modelled by an observed Poisson process with intensity (rate) ?(t)+?0, where ?(t) is the information carrying input waveform and ?0 represents the `dark current'. The capacity of this channel is considered within a restricted class of peak power ?(t)\&les;A and average power E(?(t))\&les;? constrained-pulse amplitude modulated-input waveforms. Within this class where ?(t)=?i, during the ith signalling interval i?\&les;t<(i+1)? the `symbol duration' ? affects the spectral properties (`bandwidth') of ?(t). The capacity achieving distribution of the symbols {?i} is determined by setting {?i} to be an independent identically distributed sequence of discrete random variables taking on a finite number of values. The two valued distribution of ? with mass points located at 0 and A is capacity achieving for ?=A (no average power constraint) and ?0=0, in the region 0<A?<3.3679. In the following region (3.3679\&les; A?<?) the ternary distribution is capacity achieving with the additional mass point rising at 0.339A},

The lower and upper bounds on I i.i.d. and I are formulated. The bounds on Ii.i.d. are calculated for independent equiprobably binary channel symbols and for causal channels with ISI memory of degree one and two. The bounds on Ii.i.d. are compared to the approximated (by Monte Carlo methods) known value of Ii.i.d. and their tightness is considered. An application of the new lower bound on Ii.i.d. yields an improvement on previously reported lower bounds for the capacity of the continuous-time strictly bandlimited (or bandpass) Gaussian channel with either peak or simultaneously peak power and bandlimiting constraints imposed on the channel's input waveform},

  abstract  = {A coding technique is described which improves error performance of synchronous data links without sacrificing data rate or requiring more bandwidth. This is achieved by channel coding with expanded sets of multilevel/phase signals in a manner which increases free Euclidean distance. Soft maximum--likelihood (ML) decoding using the Viterbi algorithm is assumed. Following a discussion of channel capacity, simple hand-designed trellis codes are presented for 8 phase-shift keying (PSK) and 16 quadrature amplitude-shift keying (QASK) modulation. These simple codes achieve coding gains in the order of 3-4 dB. It is then shown that the codes can be interpreted as binary convolutional codes with a mapping of coded bits into channel signals, which we call "mapping by set partitioning." Based on a new distance measure between binary code sequences which efficiently lower-bounds the Euclidean distance between the corresponding channel signal sequences, a search procedure for more powerful codes is developed. Codes with coding gains up to 6 dB are obtained for a variety of multilevel/phase modulation schemes. Simulation results are presented and an example of carrier-phase tracking is discussed.},

  abstract  = {This paper presents an account of the current state of sampling, 50 years after Shannon's formulation of the sampling theorem. The emphasis is on regular sampling, where the grid is uniform. This topic has benefitted from a strong research revival during the past few years, thanks in part to the mathematical connections that were made with wavelet theory. To introduce the reader to the modern, Hilbert-space formulation, we reinterpret Shannon's sampling procedure as an orthogonal projection onto the subspace of band-limited functions. We then extend the standard sampling paradigm for a presentation of functions in the more general class of "shift-in-variant" function spaces, including splines and wavelets. Practically, this allows for simpler-and possibly more realistic- interpolation models, which can be used in conjunction with a much wider class of (anti-aliasing) prefilters that are not necessarily ideal low-pass. We summarize and discuss the results available for the determination of the approximation error and of the sampling rate when the input of the system is essentially arbitrary; e.g., nonbandlimited. We also review variations of sampling that can be understood from the same unifying perspective. These include wavelets, multiwavelets, Papoulis generalized sampling, finite elements, and frames. Irregular sampling and radial basis functions are briefly mentioned.},

  abstract  = {In this contribution we present a novel method for constructing orthogonal pulses for UWB impulse radio transmission under the FCC spectral mask constraint. In contrast to previous work we combine a convex formulation of the spectral design with L{\"o}wdin's orthogonalization method \cite{Low50}, which delivers a shift--orthogonal basis optimally close (in energy) to the initial pulse, which generates (in a stable way) the shift--invariant space. The convex formulation of the spectral design is achieved by approximating the FCC mask with a finite--order filter matched to Gaussian monocycles as input. The output pulse then has high energy concentration in the passband (NESP value). Using L{\"o}wdin's orthogonalization we compute the corresponding shift--orthogonal pulse. We show that our approach is able to generate for finitely many shifts, orthogonal equal energy pulses with nearly the same NESP value. Furthermore, we show that the orthogonalization procedure can be well approximated using the Zak transform allowing for an efficient implementation with the discrete Fourier transform. Surprisingly, we could observe, that for certain parameters, this approximation yields almost the same performance as the exact L{\"o}wdin method.},

  abstract  = {The spectral occupancy and composition of a chosen digital signaling technique when the data pulse stream is nonideal, due for instance to implementation imperfections, are important considerations in the design of a practical communication system. One source of imperfection is timing jitter where the rising and falling transitions do not occur at the nominal data transition time instants, nevertheless, the time instants are offset by random amounts relative to the nominal one. The amount of timing shift per transmission interval is random and is typically characterized by a discrete stationary random process (independent of the data sequence). The purpose of this paper is to characterize the power spectral density (PSD) of baseband binary data streams in the presence of uniform timing jitter. Examples of uncorrelated data pulse stream, and i.i.d. data stream are given. Interesting results emerge when the generating sequence {an} is uncorrelated. For generating sequences {an} that are non-zero mean, timing jitter has the effect of widening the main lobe of the spectrum and increasing the sidelobes. When the generating sequence is zero mean and uncorrelated, a rather surprising result is that the timing jitter does not effect the PSD. Simulation results are also presented to verify the analysis},

To this end, we propose a convex optimization based waveform design method for UWB radios. By casting the pulse design problem as a (convex) semidefinite program (SDP) over the pulse autocorrelation, globally optimal waveform designs can be efficiently obtained. While the focus of this paper is on the design of waveforms that optimally utilize the bandwidth and power allowed by the spectral mask, the flexibility of the SDP framework also allows the optimization of several other system objectives.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper addresses the problem of estimating the peak value of bandlimited signals from their samples with and without oversampling. This problem has significant relevance to orthogonal frequency-division multiplexing (OFDM) signal processing and system design. In particular, an upper bound on the peak value is established given the peak value of the samples and the oversampling rate. Moreover, it is shown that the bounds are sharp for all practical rates by constructing bandlimited signals taking on this bound. The proof also provides a local characterization of bandlimited signals in the neighborhood of an extremum. A different analysis examines the effect of small errors in the samples. It is shown that oversampling can provide robust recovery in the sense that small errors in the samples lead to small errors in the reconstructed signal. Again, an upper bound is derived relating the peak error in the samples and the peak error in the signals. Furthermore, both problems are shown to be coupled and put in a unifying context. The bounds are compared and applied to problems concerning OFDM.},

The behavior is characterized in terms of the complementary distribution function of the crest-factor (CDFC). The CDFC is a key parameter of OFDM systems, for example it provides limits on achievable information rates. Several approximations have been developed in the literature so far, but no true upper bounds dependent on the different constellations that are used in OFDM modulation have been derived. A new approach is given providing upper bounds that substitute for time-consuming simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {A new class of codes is defined and analyzed when applied to a communication system that sends data over a bandlimited Gaussian channel. A code word is defined as a sequence ofr-phase values and transmitted either modulated on a carrier or transformed inton = 2rsamples on a baseband channel. An algebraic procedure is used to generate the phase sequence from a set ofpequidistant angles. The baseband model is analyzed in detail and the performance is evaluated by first assuming an ideal detector and computing an error-probability bound. Takingp = 61,73, and97, codes are shown to exist that perform close to the theoretical limit. The algebraic structure of these codes much simplifies the numerical analysis. A second receiver is defined that extracts phase values out of the received waveform and then performs a suitable quantization. The degradation of this detector appears to be moderate for low information rates when evaluated forp = 61. A carrier phase-modulated system is also defined and evaluated with a performance quite similar to the baseband model.},
